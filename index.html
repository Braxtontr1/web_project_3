                    where it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and
                    accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1
                    to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen
                    King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

                    company in the history of the world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland
                    headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry.
                    Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians.
                    These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>
