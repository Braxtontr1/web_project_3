# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

## Overview

A Responsive website that gives the user an idea of what could await them on a cross country trip.

## Purpose

* To test my knowledge of css and html.
* To build a responsive website from scratch.
* And to test working off a design from a design tool like Figma.

### Issues and fixes

Website may not be perfectly responsive on all devices. I plan to smooth out all transitions and make it responisive for larger screens as well.
